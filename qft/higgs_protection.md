# Higgs Protection (Hierarchy)

## Claim (programmatic)
Large VGV suppresses cross-scale coupling so Higgs mass corrections are bounded.

v1 target:
- express a modified loop correction:
\[
\delta m_H^2 \sim \frac{\Lambda^2}{16\pi^2}\,\Sigma(GV)
\]
where \(\Sigma(GV)\) encodes suppression.

Then state a measurable implication (even qualitative):
- reduced sensitivity to UV scale under certain GV regimes.
