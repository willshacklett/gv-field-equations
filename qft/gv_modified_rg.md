# GV-Modified RG (Sketch)

## Goal
Describe how bounded gradients suppress UV→IR flow (hierarchy protection idea).

Program:
- define how GV modifies effective couplings \(g(\mu;GV)\)
- test RG closure (does the theory remain consistent under running?)

v1 target:
- propose a single suppression factor form and its consequences for loop corrections.
