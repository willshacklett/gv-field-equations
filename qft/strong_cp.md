# Strong CP (θ dynamics)

## Question
Does GV drive \(\theta\to 0\) via relaxation (without introducing an axion)?

Program idea:
- treat \(\theta\) as linked to gradient topology states
- include a relaxation term in an effective potential:
\[
V(\theta;GV)
\]

v1 target:
- propose a minimal dynamical equation for \(\theta(t)\) coupled to GV.
