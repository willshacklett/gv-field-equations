# Inflation (Supercritical Regime)

## Claim (programmatic)
Inflation corresponds to a regime where GV potential dominates and yields quasi-de Sitter expansion.

Condition (v0):
\[
V(GV)\gg \frac{1}{2}K(GV)\dot{GV}^2
\Rightarrow w \approx -1
\]

## End of inflation (reheating sketch)
Inflation ends when GV rolls/relaxes and energy transfers into standard sectors.

## v1 Target
Compute:
- \(n_s\)
- \(r\)
under one specific \(K(GV),V(GV)\) choice.
