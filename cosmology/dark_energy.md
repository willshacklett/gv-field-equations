# Dark Energy (Undercritical Tail)

## Claim (programmatic)
Late-time acceleration is the residual relaxation tail of the same GV scalar.

If \(\dot{GV}\) is small:
\[
w(z)\to -1
\]

## v1 Target
Choose a potential that naturally yields:
- near-constant \(w\approx -1\)
- slight deviation tied to structure growth
