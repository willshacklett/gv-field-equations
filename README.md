# GV Field Equations

This repository contains the formal mathematical program for the God Variable (GV).

Unlike the main `god-variable-theory` hub (concept + ecosystem),
this repo is strictly for quantitative development.

The goal:

> Move GV from conceptual coherence to predictive field theory.

# Master Equation (Working Form)

We treat GV as a dynamical scalar constraint field:

\[
\partial_t GV = -\nabla \cdot J_{GV} + S(GV)
\]

Where:

- \(J_{GV}\) = constraint gradient transport
- \(S(GV)\) = curvature / instability source terms

Embedded in cosmology:

\[
H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho_{\text{eff}}(GV)
\]

# Research Targets

To be considered viable, GV must:

- Match Planck CMB data
- Produce viable inflation spectrum (n_s, r, f_NL)
- Protect Higgs mass via UV→IR suppression
- Resolve strong CP without axion
- Reproduce black hole entropy scaling
- Preserve unitarity in evaporation
- Match SN Ia and BAO Λ constraints

# Philosophy

GV is not introduced as a new particle.

It is a constraint scalar governing:

- Stability
- Gradient transport
- Cross-scale coupling suppression

Symmetries emerge as attractors of constraint minimization.

# Status

⚠️ Speculative / Research stage  
This repository documents a working theoretical program — not established physics.

---

Coherence is required before belief.
Prediction is required before acceptance.
