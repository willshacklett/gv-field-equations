# Perturbations (Linearized)

## Goal
Linearize around a background solution and identify propagating modes.

Let:
\[
GV(x,t) = \bar{GV}(t) + \delta GV(x,t)
\]

Assume FRW background for cosmology sections.

## Tasks (v1)
- derive equation for \(\delta GV_k\)
- compute power spectrum mapping to \((n_s, r, f_{NL})\) under assumptions
- identify stability criteria (no ghosts, no gradient instabilities)
