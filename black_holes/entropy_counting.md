# Black Hole Entropy Counting (Boundary Microstates)

## Claim (programmatic)
Entropy emerges from bounded gradient microstates on a horizon-like boundary.

Goal:
- show area scaling as counting of admissible configurations

v1 target:
- define a horizon saturation condition (in GV terms)
- sketch how microstate count grows ~ area (not volume)
