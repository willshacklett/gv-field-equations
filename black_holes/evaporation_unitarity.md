# Evaporation + Unitarity

## Claim (programmatic)
Hawking evaporation corresponds to redistribution of boundary-encoded microstates under GV flow, preserving unitarity.

v1 target:
- propose a toy model:
  - boundary GV saturation
  - relaxation/decay law
  - emission spectrum mapping
- compare qualitative behavior to Hawking temperature scaling
